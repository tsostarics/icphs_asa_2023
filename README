cmdstanr doesn't play well with renv for whatever reason.
Install instructions here: https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/

```r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("stan-dev/cmdstanr")
```

Otherwise, you can run the following:

```r
renv::restore() # Install all packages
library(targets)
library(tarchetypes)

tar_make() # Run analyses and render figures
```

Some notes:
 - Writeups/models.qmd runs all models and the performance metrics used for the ASA poster
 - Writeups/figures.qmd runs creates all the other figures used in the ASA poster and ICPhS paper
